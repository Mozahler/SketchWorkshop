With this drawing app you can select colors and brushes, add, resize and move layers.
Many of the menus can be pushed out of your way - just exit and return to restore them to their original place.
Swipe on the brush to change to a different one, use the slider to make the brush wider or slimmer.
Click on the play button to see all your steps reproduced and watch it paint itself.
Share your creations with your friends!

## Learn to Use Layers!

You can isolate a session or any period of time by painting on a separate layer.
Layers can be copied, combined/merged, moved over or under existing layers
You can reposition a layer, shrink or expand it, remove it
colors on a layer can be inverted, or you can paint the entire layer one color (the color pot's current color)
Take a look at the layers in the demo paintings for some ideas.  Watch the video to see how they are used.
