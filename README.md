Information and Privacy Policy for SketchWorkshop Drawing App

### Message to Testers
This is a drawing app.  Select colors and brushes, add and move layers.
The basic functionality is in place, but some of the buttons are not hooked up, yet.
- the "Hamburger" is your back button for now (push it anywhere you want on the screen - it disappears like the other buttons when you want to draw)
- when editing a brush, the newly edited brush works, but isn't saved correctly
- after selecting a painting, it flashes before settling on its landing page
- importing and resizing images from the gallery is not functional
- bluetooth functionality is not in place because unsigned binaries are not allowed (I will research this)
- pixel size label on the brush cell is not initialized to correct size (they all say 12 unless in use - what is the size of a brush that has never been created for use?)
